# QAOA MaxCut Project

This project implements and analyzes the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** for solving the **MaxCut** problem on unweighted graphs, using both **PennyLane** and **Qiskit** quantum programming frameworks.

---

## üìå Project Summary

The MaxCut problem is a classical NP-hard optimization problem that involves partitioning the vertices of a graph to maximize the number of edges crossing the partition. QAOA provides a variational quantum-classical hybrid approach for approximating such solutions.

In this project:
- QAOA circuits were implemented using **PennyLane** and reproduced using **Qiskit** and **OpenQASM**.
- Graphs of sizes 4, 6, and 8 nodes were tested.
- Performance was evaluated under varying circuit depths \( p \) to study convergence behavior and approximation quality.
- Circuit structures, energy landscapes, and output distributions were visualized.
- A quantum kernel-based classification approach for MaxCut was also briefly explored.

## üß† Key Findings

- QAOA achieves optimal or near-optimal MaxCut solutions on small graphs.
- Increasing QAOA depth \( p \) improves performance but adds circuit complexity.
- Energy landscape visualizations provide insight into parameter optimization.
- Careful attention must be paid when reproducing QAOA results across frameworks due to qubit-node mapping (especially in OpenQASM).
